# logseq-neon-theme
Neon inspired Theme for logseq

Started a month ago to use [LogSeq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) and missing on a shiny dark Theme I actually like to use daily. Not only for journal, also for code and snippets. Some existings dark themes lack a bit in vibrant visibility, so I created this one.

## Theme Features
- dark theme only with vibrant colors
- good for both code and notes
- bullet threading

## Screenshots
- TODO 

## Customization
- You can always change variables in the custom.css by opening Logseq settings and click "Edit custom.css" this will override the Themes defaults. Simple example to adjust the overall Font Size add this:

```css
:root {
  --ls-page-text-size: 18px;
}
```
